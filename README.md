# Serverless Learning
I recently discovered [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and started to appreciate all the things I could do with them. 

This repo will serve as a catch-all, much like my [react-bytes](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes) repo, for all things serverless. I will focus primarily on APIs, maybe some localization, and client-side frameworks (Astro) at the edge. Also looking at things like AWS Amplify and Hono.

Each top-level directory will be one project. No this isn't the most efficient way to do things, but I'm not quite to the monorepo project stage yet.
